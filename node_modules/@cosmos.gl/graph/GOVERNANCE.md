# cosmos.gl Governance Guidelines

The [TSC Charter](./CHARTER.md) governs the operations of the TSC. All changes to the Charter need approval by the OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council (CPC).

The TSC oversees all technical development in the cosmos.gl project, as long as it follows policies set by CPC, including:
- Setting release dates.  
- Release quality standards.  
- Technical direction.  
- Project governance and process.  
- GitHub repository hosting.  
- Conduct guidelines.  
- Maintaining the list of additional collaborators.  
- Development process and any coding standards.  
- Mediating technical conflicts between collaborators or foundation projects.

The TSC will define cosmos.gl projectâ€™s release vehicles.

### **Project Operations & Management**
The TSC will establish and maintain a development process for the cosmos.gl project. The development process will establish guidelines for how the developers and community will operate. It will, for example, establish appropriate timelines for TSC review (e.g. agenda items must be published at least a certain number of hours in advance of a TSC meeting).

The TSC and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be specified by the OpenJS Foundation Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions, including the OpenJS Foundation IP Policy.
