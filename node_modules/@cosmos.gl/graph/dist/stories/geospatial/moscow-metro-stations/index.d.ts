/**
 * This example demonstrates the importance of rescaling positions by Cosmos.
 * The Moscow Metro station coordinates are are normalized (0-1 range in both dimensions).
 * By default, cosmos.gl rescales these positions to fit the canvas.
 * When disabling rescaling (`rescalePositions: false`):
 * - Points render using raw coordinates
 * - The entire graph occupies a tiny 1x1 area in WebGL's clip space (-1 to 1)
 * - This causes visual artifacts due to WebGL's floating-point precision limitations
 * - Points cluster in the center and may exhibit rendering glitches
